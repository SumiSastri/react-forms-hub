Radio Buttons:

In terms of ui-ux radio buttons give you the option to select one from a group of options. It is not different from a select drop-down when you are using a single select drop-down.

The JSX tags are 
```<label/>```- for (innerText) attribute is forHTML in React
```<input/>``` - each input must have a unique id attribute and a checked atttribute which is a boolean value

Mapping happends through both the label and input and for multi-JSX mapping a ReactFragment must be used or a div.

The data is structured in an array but each element is a string.

Checkbox:

In terms of ui-ux a check box is like a toggle button give you the option toggle a yes/no and this is in its single select form. With a check box, often a toggle button designed so that the selector is animated is often more popular.

In a multi-select version it allows as many boxes to be checked as the user requires.
