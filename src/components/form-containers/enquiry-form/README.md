- Created reusable components for this task
- HeaderComponent.js
- SelectFilter.js
- InputText.js
- ButtonComponent.js
- The DatePicker library was used for the date input ( I find the date object difficult to use)
- Simple validation - using the required field as a prop and conditional rendering
- Mock-data was created in JSON format
- Some styling that I had in this forms hub used
- All of this did not take just 2 hours as I wanted to use React-Hooks (so a bit of a learning-curve)
- Thinking through reusable components also took more time but the view is that these could be reused once the initial work done.


Challenges: - 
- "Date of payslip being queried" is required for the "Incorrect Pay" and "Missing Expense" options only - research needed for conditional rendering (approach would be to grab index of the values for conditional rendering)

- Date Picker Library - date not submitted from the picker - further reading of documentation required.
