### React-form hub
- Repo access
- $git clone 
- $npm init -y
- $npm run start
- Removed yarn as a package manager

### Project goals

This is an experimental, personal side-project to understand forms with React/ React-Hooks / React-Redux, TypeScript, front-end validation and testing-libraries.

It is a work-in-progress project, where I update sections as I learn and understand how each of the moving parts work in conjunction with each-other.
